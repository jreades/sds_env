You can install the updated Terminal and Git/GitHub Desktop whenever you like, and you shouldn't encounter any issues as these are quite straightforward applications. When setting up GitHub Desktop please ensure that you **use your UCL email address** to create the new account with GitHub.

If you *don't* see this window (or see lots of errors) then you may need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](./problems.qmd)' section.
