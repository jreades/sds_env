## MacOS

You need the **Xcode Command Line Tools** installed on your Mac. In some cases this may have *already* been installed, but it's the same process to check as to install:

1. Open the `Terminal` application (which can be found under `Utilities` in your `Applications` folder).
2. Type the following: `xcode-select --install` and then hit Enter (&#9166;)

Unless you get an *error*, you can proceed to the next step.

## Windows

You will need to install WSL2 but, strangely, you do not actually need to install a full Linux O/S, so as far as we can tell this means you only need to do the following:

1. Open the `Windows PowerShell` application (which you can find from the 'search' button)
2. Type the following: `wsl --install` and then hit Enter (&#9166;)

That *should* be it, but please read the output of this command is *not* an error! Unless you get an *error*, you can proceed to the next step.

### If You Need More Help

If you cannot install WSL2 then please have a look at the [problems](./problems.qmd) page, but there is also good guidance [from Microsoft](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) for Windows 11 and more recent 'builds' of Windows 10^[There are also [older instructions](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-2-on-microsoft-windows-10) for Windows 10.].

Common installation errors are [covered here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/troubleshooting?source=recommendations).

Finally, if you are *still* being told that you can't install WSL2 and Linux, then the most likely cause of this issue is a setting in the BIOS of the computer itself. There are a couple of settings that need changing at a very low level to enable Hyper-V virtualisation. I would start by following [this MS guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual) and, if there is still a problem, check [this blog post](https://s1gr1d.medium.com/how-to-set-up-linux-on-windows-with-wsl-2-debe2a64d20d).
