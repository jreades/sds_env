## Get a GitHub Account

You will need to go to [GitHub.com](https://github.com/) and then click the `Sign up` button at the top right. Follow the instructions for creating a new account from there.

## Use Your Personal Account

Although you can always change it later (so if you've opened your GitHub account using your UCL email don't panic!), you may find it easier to:

- Open a GitHub account using a personal email address to which you expect to always have access.
- Then associate your UCL email address to this GitHub account so that you gain from any educational benefits offered by GitHub (there are some around private respositories and so on).
