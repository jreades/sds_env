## Understanding Docker

### What is Virtualisation?

Docker is 'virtualisation' tool that allows you to run 'virtual machines' on your computer's 'host' operating system. That's a lot of new, probably meaningless words. If you're one of those people who (understandably) likes to understand what's going on then here's how some people define it:

1. Google on [What is a virtual machine](https://cloud.google.com/learn/what-is-a-virtual-machine#)?
2. VMWare on [What is a virtual machine](https://www.vmware.com/topics/virtual-machine#)?
3. Microsoft on [What is a virtual machine (VM)](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/resources/cloud-computing-dictionary/what-is-a-virtual-machine)?

### Docker in a Nutshell

So in order to make use of Docker (and understand what's happening when you get errors), it's helpful to have _some_ sense of what's going on behind the scenes. You can click on the image below to make it larger, or you can download and print out [a PDF version](../img/Docker.pdf).

Here's what's happening:

#### Step 1. `docker pull`

You issue the `docker pull {{< var env.image >}}` command to your computer, which turns around and asks Docker Hub for a copy of this image. Docker Hub responds by transferring a copy of the `{{< var env.image >}}` **image** to your computer. You now have a file containing all the instructions to set up and run a **virtual machine** on your computer.^[A virtual machine is just a computer that runs _on_ your computer. So it 'borrows' resources like hard drive space, memory, and processor in order to behave like an independent computer that you can interact with in various ways.]

#### Step 2, `docker run`

You issue the `docker run ... {{< var env.image >}} ...` command (which you'll be running in a minute) from your computer, and this tells Docker to use the `{{< var env.image >}}` **image** as a template for creating a **container** called `{{< var env.name >}}`^[A container is the name Docker uses to refer to a _running_ virtual machine. The image on its own does nothing until you tell docker to `run` it, at which point it becomes a container!]. `{{< var env.name >}}` will do _whatever_ it was told to do by its creator. This could be wait to run Python code, start up a database, serve web pages, the list is practically endless. But {{< var env.name >}} is _read-only_, although you can make changes to the container while it's running, as soon as you shut it down those changes are lost. So you cannot break a Docker image, only a container. And if you do that, you delete the container and start a new one from the image... we can cover this if you ever do it.

As part of the `docker run` command, we also told Docker what resources the container could access. There are two main types of resources for our purposes:

- A **mount point** which is a part of your computer's hard drive that Docker can use to write things down permanently. We use `$(pwd)`, which is short-hand for `print working directory` and refers to the 'place' on your computer where we issued the `docker run` command. We tell Docker to connect this to a directory called `work` (which resides in `/home/jovyan/`) on the `{{< var env.name >}}` container. This allows you to share data between the container and your computer, and for changes to be saved when you shut down Docker.
- One or more **ports** which are like channels on a radio where the container can talk to other computers (including yours). In this case, we connect port 8888 on `{{< var env.name >}}` to port 8888 on your computer. And _that_ is why you have to tell your browser to go to [`localhost:8888`](http://localhost:8888) to access Jupyter Lab.

#### Step 4. Interacting with the Container

Now when you type things into the browser and tell code to 'run', what's actually happening is that your computer is forwarding the request to the container, which does its thing, updates the web page, and this change is then forwarded back to you via the browser.

#### Step 5. Anatomy of `docker run`

In the next section you'll see the *full* Docker `run` command, here we just want to focus on the most important options (each `-X` is an option) for most users:

- `-v`: this specified the point on your hard drive that the {{< var env.name >}} can use. By default we use `$(pwd)` which means 'use the location where the `docker run` command was executed. You can also 'hard code' this to something like `/Users/<your username>/Documents/casa/fsds/` if you always want to use the same location.
- `-p`: this specified the channel (or `port`) on which the web browser can talk to the {{< var env.name >}}.
- `{{< var env.image >}}`: this specified the image we wanted to use
