## Testing Docker

To test if Docker is installed correctly, you will need either the `Terminal` (macOS) or the `Power Shell` (Windows).

## Copy Code to Clipboard 

Whenever you see a 'code block' below, you will _also_ see a 'clipboard' icon (![Copy to Clipboard Icon](../img/copy-to-clipboard.png){height="18px"}) in the right. Click that, and the code will be copied to your computer's 'clipboard' so that you can then paste it into the `Terminal` or `Power Shell`. That will save you a lot of time and effort.

:::

Docker has provided a simple way to test if your installation is working correctly. You can run the following command in the `Terminal` or `Power Shell`:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This should output something like:

```plaintext
Unable to find image 'hello-world:latest' locally
latest: Pulling from library/hello-world
478afc919002: Pull complete
Digest: sha256:91fb4b041da273d5a3273b6d587d62d518300a6ad268b28628f74997b93171b2
Status: Downloaded newer image for hello-world:latest

Hello from Docker!
This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
 1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
 2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
    (arm64v8)
 3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
    executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
 4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
    to your terminal.

To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
 $ docker run -it ubuntu bash

If you see this message, then Docker is installed correctly and you can move on to the next step. If you see an error message, then you will need to have a look at the '[dealing with errors](#dealing-with-errors)' section. Notice how there are several things happening:

1. `Unable to find image... locally` -- this is because the `hello-world` image is not (yet) stored on your computer.
2. `latest: Pulling from library/hello-world` -- this is Docker downloading the `hello-world` image from the internet.
3. `Pull complete` -- this is Docker telling you that it has finished downloading the image.
4. `Hello from Docker!` -- this is the `hello-world` image running and telling you that Docker is working correctly.

There's obviously a *lot* more to that message, but that's the basic idea.

## Installing {{< var env.name >}}

We now need to download the {{< var env.name >}} **image** that we use for teaching *Foundations* and *Quantitative Methods*. The image is the 'template' for running virtual machines (i.e. computers) on our 'host' computer and it comes complete with all of the Python libraries and other tools that you'll need to complete the module (and a good deal more besides!). Installing the image will take a while as it's quite large (2-5GB) and so will depend on the speed of your internet connection.

## Intel Macs and Windows

If your Apple computer has an Intel chipset (see: &#63743; -> `About this Mac` -> `Processor`) or is running Windows:

```bash
docker pull {{< var env.image >}}
```

## Silicon/M-Chip Macs

If your Apple computer has an M1 or M2 'Silicon' chipset (see: &#63743; -> `About this Mac` -> `Processor`): 

```bash
docker pull {{< var env.image >}}-silicon
```

:::

## Using {{< var env.name >}}

Now that you have the image downloaded, you can start an {{< var env.name >}} **container** by copying the following command into the `Terminal` or `Power Shell` (*this does not work in the Command Prompt*/`cmd`):

## For Intel Macs

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 \
   -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" \
  {{< var env.image >}} start.sh jupyter lab \
  --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

## For M-Chip Macs

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 \
   -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" \
  {{< var env.image >}}-silicon start.sh jupyter lab \
  --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```

## For Windows

```bash
docker run --rm -d --name {{< var env.name >}} -p 8888:8888 -v "$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work" {{< var env.image >}} start.sh jupyter lab --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''
```
