# How to Think

## Why am I Making This Hard for You?

Another challenge for many students is that they want the 'right' answer to how to do things. There's more academic literature on this, but for a thought-provoking look at why it might be a good idea for us to make your life *hard* then [What IKEA and Our Education System Have in Common](https://medium.com/the-mission/what-ikea-and-our-education-system-have-in-common-its-not-a-good-thing-1a61e56a8394) is an easy read. 

Here's the summary:

1. IKEA is easy, but you don't learn anything.
2. IKEA is about getting things done/finishing.
3. IKEA is convenient, but it's not creative.
4. IKEA is standardised, but it is *actually* primed for hacking.

But there is a great response to the original post that adds nuance to this:

> The thing to keep in mind, though, is that following recipies is how we learn skills to start with. If you were teaching someone to cook, for example, you wouldn’t throw the person into the kitchen and tell them to be creative with the food. Instead, you would teach them to follow recipies so that they can practice skills, and learn how to properly balance flavours and textures. Then, when they’ve mastered some recipies, you teach them how to mix up and re-combine recipies, and eventually come up with their own.

## Thinking Like a Programmer

For the record, there are many things that *can't* be solved by code or coders, but there are many things that can be tackled by [learning to think *like* a programmer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/how-to-think-like-a-programmer-lessons-in-problem-solving-d1d8bf1de7d2/). This can include:

1. **Understanding**: make sure that you actually understand the problem before you try to solve it. Try to explain it to someone else. Try to explain it to a pet or stuffed animal. Write it down. You may feel silly doing some of these things, but saying it/writing it forces you to organise your thoughts and often gives you the answer halfway through the explanation.
2. **Planning**: "Given X, what steps do I need to achieve Y?" You can start with comments, bullet points, or whatever format helps you to get the *skeleton* of an answer in place before you spend ages writing the first few lines of code *or* the first few lines of your essay. Markdown is good here!
3. **Dividing**: *never* try to solve a hard problem in one go. Break it down into little steps. Easy steps. Do the *easiest* one first (if you can separate it out from the *first* one). Check your solution works for that *part*. Take the next step. Check the two steps work together. Build from there. As programmers *and* Venture Capitalists would tell you: iterate! Same for an essay or written submission.
4. **Unsticking**: try to stay curious rather than getting angry or frustrated. Debugging is a step-by-step process: comment things out, add `print` statements, break it back down again into the basics and gradually re-add pieces until you can see where it all breaks. 
5. **Practicing**: I like this quote "Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that 'this problem could easily be solved with <insert concept here>.'”

## What This Means for You

- We will not *give* you the answer. This will be frustrating and annoying (particularly when you are already frustrated that something is not working) but by asking you questions we will try to teach you to solve problems *for yourself*.
- If you keep asking us the *same* questions you will get increasingly abrupt answers. You *should* be scared to ask us the *same* question for the 20th time. You should *not* be scared to admit that you're struggling with something.
- Sometimes there *is* no answer! Every year the data changes. The policies and issues change. I teach things a little differently. This is much more like the real world and sometimes I don't know what we'll find when we start coding. 
- You need to work out how *you* learn best.
- You will need to think critically about what you are doing. There's a good article on [How to write better essays](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2017/mar/07/how-to-write-an-essay) which leads on to [a blog on how to write better undergraduate essays](https://www.timsquirrell.com/blog/how-to-write-undergraduate-essays) (see above). You're obviously not undergraduates any more and we expect *more* of you, but as a starting point this is a good one, especially for those of you who are new to the UK way of teaching and learning.
