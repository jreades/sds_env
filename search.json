    "text": "Thinking Like a Programmer\nFor the record, there are many things that can’t be solved by code or coders, but there are many things that can be tackled by learning to think like a programmer. This can include:\n\nUnderstanding: make sure that you actually understand the problem before you try to solve it. Try to explain it to someone else. Try to explain it to a pet or stuffed animal. Write it down. You may feel silly doing some of these things, but saying it/writing it forces you to organise your thoughts and often gives you the answer halfway through the explanation.\nPlanning: “Given X, what steps do I need to achieve Y?” You can start with comments, bullet points, or whatever format helps you to get the skeleton of an answer in place before you spend ages writing the first few lines of code or the first few lines of your essay. Markdown is good here!\nDividing: never try to solve a hard problem in one go. Break it down into little steps. Easy steps. Do the easiest one first (if you can separate it out from the first one). Check your solution works for that part. Take the next step. Check the two steps work together. Build from there. As programmers and Venture Capitalists would tell you: iterate! Same for an essay or written submission.\nUnsticking: try to stay curious rather than getting angry or frustrated. Debugging is a step-by-step process: comment things out, add print statements, break it back down again into the basics and gradually re-add pieces until you can see where it all breaks.\nPracticing: I like this quote “Practice. Practice. Practice. It’ll only be a matter of time before you recognize that ‘this problem could easily be solved with .’”\n\n\n“The art of debugging is figuring out what you really told your program to do rather than what you thought you told it to do.” — Andrew Singer\n\nOn a more practical level, here are common mistakes made by new programmers.",

This will be frustrating and annoying (particularly when you are already frustrated that something is not working) but by asking you questions we will try to teach you to solve problems for yourself.\nIf you keep asking us the same questions you will get increasingly abrupt answers. You should be scared to ask us the same question for the 20th time. You should not be scared to admit that you’re struggling with something.\nSometimes there is no answer! Every year the data changes. The policies and issues change. I teach things a little differently. This is much more like the real world and sometimes I don’t know what we’ll find when we start coding.\nYou need to work out how you learn best.\nYou will need to think critically about what you are doing. There’s a good article on How to write better essays which leads on to a blog on how to write better undergraduate essays (see above). You’re obviously not undergraduates any more and we expect more of you, but as a starting point this is a good one, especially for those of you who are new to the UK way of teaching and learning.",

Learning how to think for yourself is essential.\nAsking for help: just because we want you to become an organised, motivated self-learner does not mean we don’t want to help you achieve this! Suffering in silence is not going to get you extra marks, so we’ve also offered tips on how to ask for help in a way that is most likely to get you what you need.\n\nThese pages are by no means complete, nor will the advice they offer work for everyone, but it is absolutely essential that you are as aware of how you learn as you are of what you are learning.

    "text": "Managing Distraction\nSo my recommendations for studying (online or offline) are:\n\nTurn off as many notifications as possible. On the Mac there is a ‘Do not disturb’ setting that you can enable in the Notifications section of your System Preferences. You can set it to turn on by time, and also add a setting short-cut to your ‘Notification Centre’ (upper-right corner of your desktop).\nUninstall messaging apps that you cannot turn off. If quitting the app disables notifications then that’s fine. But if you can’t disable notifications then I’d suggest uninstalling the messaging app entirely. Facebook Messenger, for instance, is a massive memory-hog and usually available on the desktop UI anyway.\nBlock access to distracting web sites. There are a number of tools that you can set up to block access to Facebook and other social media sites at set times of day. My Achilles heel is the news: if I’m struggling I tend to read news articles, so if I really need to make sure I don’t have the browser open to the home page of my favourite news sites.\nWork out a schedule. It’s a lot easier to avoid distractions if you have a routine that enables you to say “OK, I will work from 9–11 and then have a look at my email.” It is easier to be in control if you can give yourself rewards later. And if you get into a routine, as a parent probably suggested when you were an undergraduate (certainly mine did and I ignored them), then you’ll find that your ‘productivity’ improves dramatically. My mother was right, dammit.",

Because Markdown is faster, simpler, and just gets out of the way when we’re writing. So rather than fiddling about with Word’s styles (or, worse, discovering that you should have been using styles all along) or with LaTeX’s painful table layout, you can just get on with writing in Markdown and then export to Word or LaTeX for the final steps. Best of both worlds!\nIn fact, Markdown is so handy that it’s become the default for writing content for the web.

Together with the Working Copy Git client for iOS I’ve used iA Writer to draft articles, make notes directly in my codebase, and correct errors found at the last minute in my teaching materials. Like Typora, iA Writer is probably intended more for writing text, not writing complex Reveal.js presentations or non-standard markdown.\n\n\nI don’t have access to a Windows machine to test this out, but there are plenty of opinions to be found by Googling ‘best Windows Markdown editors’ or ‘best free Windows Markdown editors’. There’s one for writers and a more generic set of recommendations. Have a look around and see what you like!\n\n\nIf you use Linux already do you really need a recommendation? How about vim or vi?",

In our Foundations of Spatial Data Science module we use Quarto to do submissions but that’s largely because it demonstrates how we can Quarto to write whole articles or dissertation!\nIn many cases, it is as straightforward as installing Quarto and then running quarto render ..., but there are some tricks. In particular, to ‘render’ Markdown files to PDF, you will need to have some flabour to TeX installed. The default suggested by Quarto is TinyTex, and this can be installed using:\nquarto install tool tinytex\nBut on some platforms there are additional issues:\n\nMacWindows\n\n\nYou will probably be able to successfully install tinytex, but then be told that no TeX installation could be found when trying to render. The issue relates to the $PATH where Quarto searches for a valid TeX installation and when completing the installation you may have seen a warning to the effect of “To complete the installation, please run the following…”\nSo that’s basically what we need to do. The first thing you need to do is find the TinyTeX binaries, in the cases that I’ve been able to fix these were found under something like $HOME/Library/TinyTex/bin/, but you may need to look further under $HOME/Library/ to find the TinyTex directory.\nOnce you know where TinyTeX is (adjust the cd command below as necessary), you can then follow the suggestion given:\ncd $HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin/\n./universal-darwin/tlmgr option sys_bin $HOME/Library/TinyTeX/bin\n./universal-darwin/tlmgr path add\nThat should do it, but in case you are still getting errors, then the following might be necessary (again, adjust the path if necessary):\necho \"export PATH=\\\"/Users/$(whoami)/Library/TinyTeX/bin:\\$PATH\\\"\" &gt;&gt; $HOME/.zshrc\nThe command above uses whoami to set the username and assumes that’s how things should be set up, but don’t blindly copy+paste and assume this will work! You could, for instance, check this location exists first using: ls /Users/$(whoami)/Library/TinyTeX/bin/ That will show if the path exists! The above command then updates the $PATH variable used by your Terminal to look for binaries, enabling Quarto to find TinyTeX once you close and then re-open a new Shell.\n\n\nMost commands seem to require replacing quarto with quarto.exe to run correctly. So quarto render Template.qmd becaomes quarto.exe render Template.qmd.\nHowever, if you are still getting errors to the effect that Quarto cannot be found then you may need to make additional edites to your .bashrc file (this is the configuration file for bash):\n\nCheck where Quarto is installed, it is most likely under /mnt/c/Users/&lt;Your Username&gt;/AppData/Local/Programs/Quarto/bin (replace &lt;Your Username&gt; as appropriate.\nEdit the .bashrc file in your $HOME directory. On Windows I would Google search for the best way to do this: “edit .bashrc file Windows”.\nAdd the following line at the end of the file: export PATH=/mnt/c/Users/&lt;Your Username&gt;/AppData/Local/Programs/Quarto/bin:$PATH\nSave the file and run source .bashrc in the Terminal.\nYou should now be able to run the following command successfully: quarto.exe --help",

    "text": "Understanding Docker\nIn order to make use of Docker (and understand what’s happening when you get errors), it’s helpful to have some sense of what’s going on behind the scenes. You can click on the image below to make it larger, or you can download and print out a PDF version.\n\n\n\nSketch of Docker Usage\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM1/M2 Macs\n\n\n\nRemember that on an M1 or M2 Mac you need to add -silicon to the docker image name. So jreades/sds:2023 becomes jreades/sds:2023-silicon.\n\n\nSo here’s what’s happening:\n\nStep 1. docker pull\nYou issue the docker pull jreades/sds:2023 command to your computer, which turns around and asks Docker Hub for a copy of this image. Docker Hub responds by transferring a copy of the jreades/sds:2023 image to your computer. You now have a file containing all the instructions to set up and run a virtual machine on your computer.1\n\n\nStep 2, docker run\nYou issue the docker run ... jreades/sds:2023 ... command (which you’ll be running in a minute) from your computer, and this tells Docker to use the jreades/sds:2023 image as a template for creating a container called sds20232. sds2023 will do whatever it was told to do by its creator. This could be wait to run Python code, start up a database, serve web pages, the list is practically endless. But sds2023 is read-only, although you can make changes to the container while it’s running, as soon as you shut it down those changes are lost. So you cannot break a Docker image, only a container. And if you do that, you delete the container and start a new one from the image… we can cover this if you ever do it.\nAs part of the docker run command, we also told Docker what resources the container could access. There are two main types of resources for our purposes:\n\nA mount point which is a part of your computer’s hard drive that Docker can use to write things down permanently. We use $(pwd), which is short-hand for print working directory and refers to the ‘place’ on your computer where we issued the docker run command. We tell Docker to connect this to a directory called work (which resides in /home/jovyan/) on the sds2023 container. This allows you to share data between the container and your computer, and for changes to be saved when you shut down Docker.\nOne or more ports which are like channels on a radio where the container can talk to other computers (including yours). In this case, we connect port 8888 on sds2023 to port 8888 on your computer. And that is why you have to tell your browser to go to localhost:8888 to access Jupyter Lab.\n\n\n\nStep 4. Interacting with the Container\nNow when you type things into the browser and tell code to ‘run’, what’s actually happening is that your computer is forwarding the request to the container, which does its thing, updates the web page, and this change is then forwarded back to you via the browser.\n\n\nStep 5. Anatomy of docker run\nIn the next section you’ll see the full Docker run command, here we just want to focus on the most important options (each -X is an option) for most users:\n\n-v: this specified the point on your hard drive that the sds2023 can use. By default we use $(pwd) which means ‘use the location where the docker run command was executed. You can also ’hard code’ this to something like /Users/&lt;your username&gt;/Documents/casa/fsds/ if you always want to use the same location.\n-p: this specified the channel (or port) on which the web browser can talk to the sds2023.\njreades/sds:2023: this specified the image we wanted to use\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEssential Topic\n\n\n\nThis next section is essential to running the sds2023 environment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCopy Code to Clipboard\n\n\n\nWhenever you see a ‘code block’, you will also see a ‘clipboard’ icon () in the right. Click that, and the code will be copied to your computer’s ‘clipboard’ so that you can then paste it into the Terminal or Power Shell. That will save you a lot of time and effort."

    "text": "VSCode Integration\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAdvanced Topic\n\n\n\nThis next section is only if you want to program in VSCode instead of Jupyter Lab. This is not needed for most students.\n\n\nIn principle the below will work. We have it working on Mac OSX and the same process should work on Windows. In practice, this should be considered a ‘beta feature’ in the sense that the documentation is still in development and we’re working out a few kinks. We’ll keep you posted on our progress!\n\nUsing Devcontainer\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCurrently Broken\n\n\n\nWe’re investigating why this approach doesn’t work, but we’re currently unable to get the devcontainer approach to run successfully despite having attempted to update it for 2023. We’ll correct this when we can.\n\n\nThe easier (but less tested) way to connect is to download the contents of test-vscode-project from GitHub. You should place the three resources in the same directory on your computer where you plan to save your notebooks, data, and other resources (e.g. $HOME/Documents/CASA/fsds/).\nYou then tell VSCode to Open Workspace from File and point it to this directory. It should then ask if you want to run the container associated with the project. The first time you do this it may take some time to get started as it still has to pull the image from Docker Hub. You can break this into steps by running docker pull jreades/sds:2023 before dealing with downloading these files and moving them into position.\n\n\nUsing Attach to Running Container\nTo enable VSCode integration you’ll need to create additional ‘mount points’ (‘locations’ on your computer’s file system) that the Docker image can access. At this point the command becomes very long, which is why there is a script designed to make this a more straightforward process provided below.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nM1/M2 Macs\n\n\n\nRemember to add -silicon to the image name (jreades/sds:2023) if you are suing a M1 or M2 Mac.\n\n\ndocker run --rm -d --name sds2023 \\\n  -p 8888:8888 -p 4201:4201 -p 8787:8787 \\\n  -v \"$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work\" \\\n  -v \"${HOME}/.vscode/containers/sds2023-extensions:/home/jovyan/.vscode-server/extensions\" \\\n  -v \"${HOME}/.vscode/containers/sds2023-insiders:/home/jovyan/.vscode-server-insiders\" \\\n  jreades/sds:2023 jupyter lab --LabApp.password='' --ServerApp.password='' --NotebookApp.token=''\n\nRequired Extensions\nThis then enables you to install the required integration extensions as follows:\n\nThe Dev - Containers extension from Microsoft, which will allow you to use a Docker container as a virtual environment from VSCode.\nThe Docker extension from Microsoft, which allows you to interact with images/containers from within VSCode.\nThe Jupyter exension, which will allow you to execute Jupyter Notebooks directly within VSCode.\nThe Jupyter Renderers extension which adds support for media outputs, especially interactive ones.\nThe Pylance extension which works as a language server (will do code highlighting, syntax checking, etc.) for Python.\nThe Python extension which provides rich support for Python &gt;= 3.7.\nThe Gremlins Tracker extension which highlights non-printing characters that can make code fail to execute properly.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJupyter Keymap Extension\n\n\n\nThe “Jupyter Keymap” exension which provides the same keymaps in VSCode that exist in JupyterLab is globally enabled and does not need to be installed..\n\n\nYou can supplement these with the Markdown linting extension and a range of other tools.\nOnce this is all installed, you start up your Docker container (as above) and then tell VSCode to connect to that container using the instructions provided.\nOnce you’ve gone through this once it should be fairly straightforward on subsequent runs. At that point you can browse to the notebooks (which are usually being mounted from your own machine) and run them as if you were doing all of this within the Docker container. It’s kind of mind-melting but pretty cool.\n\n\nConnect\nUse the Remote Containers icon () to bring up the ‘open’ menu.\n\n\n\nThe Remote Containers Dialogue\n\n\n\n\nAttach\nChoose the Attach to Running Container... option to list active Docker containers.\n\n\n\nAttach to a running container\n\n\nIn this screenshot we’re running one container named fsds that was built from the jreades/sds:2022 image. Your container may have a different name (e.g. sds2023) but the image should be named jreades/sds:2023 or `jreades/sds:2023-silicon:\n\n\n\nThe list of running containers\n\n\n\n\nAttached!\nIf all has gone well, then a new window should open and you’ll notice one small, but significant change:\n\n\n\nAn attached workspace\n\n\nVSCode confirms that this window is now connected to the fsds container3:\n\n\n\nRunning on a Container\n\n\n\n\nOpen Sesame\nNow, if we try to open a file/folder under the open menu (), you’ll notice that we’re not browsing ‘our computer’ any more! Instead, we’re browsing files on the Docker container.\n\n\n\nOpening files on the container\n\n\nSo how do we find the notebooks? Well, when we launched the container we had this line:\n  -v \"$(pwd):/home/jovyan/work\" \\\nThat told Docker to connect the current working directory (where you ran the command) to /home/jovyan/work on the container. So anything under /home/jovyan/work is actually a file that can be found on our computer. Below, you can see that I’ve browsed to the fsds/practicals directory on my computer and am now ready to start running (and editing) my notebooks using an IDE instead of JupyterLab’s web interface:\n\n\n\nNotice the path on the container\n\n\n\n\nExtensions\nYou need to install the same VSCode extensions that you’d use when running Python locally on your computer into the ‘remote’ container. VSCode will do a pretty good job prompting you, but you’ve got the list above and can also seem them (notice I’ve selected CONTAINER) on the left-hand Extensions () menu in the screenshot below:\n\n\n\nExtensions installed in Container\n\n\nOnce the extensions are installed, provided that you use the same startup command each time (and don’t change the name of the container from fsds) those extensions should be ready-to-go and you won’t need to reinstall again.\n\n\nSuccess!\nAnd here we go…\n\n\n\nRunning code in a container"

    "text": "Windows + Linux + Shell\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCreating a Linux User\n\n\n\nIf you want to install a full Linux distribution (e.g. because you want to do more than just run Docker) then make sure you set up a new Linux user and do not end up running everything as root.\n\n\nTo make full use of WSL2 and Linux (if you want to do more than just use Docker) you will need to familiarise yourself with how having two operating systems that can talk to each other works. That is covered in the next section. This will actually be useful for understanding how Docker works, as it can be profoundly confusing.\nThe behaviour of the ‘shell’ (command line) is quite confusing because, with WSL2, you effectively end up with two ‘home’ directories: one for your Windows user, and one for your new Ubuntu user. Starting a Linux shell/command line puts you in your Linux home directory (the username may be completely different from your Windows username). Starting a Windows shell/command line puts you in your Windows home directory (again, the username may be completely different from your Linux username).\nSo the first, and perhaps most important, thing is understanding where ‘data’ is being stored:\n\nUnder Linux the user directory is apparently something like: \\\\wsl$\\&lt;DistroName&gt;\\home\\&lt;UserName&gt;\\ but you can usually get it by simply typing cd $HOME and then pwd when starting a new Linux shell.\nUnder Windows the user directory is: C:\\Users\\&lt;UserName&gt;\\ or /mnt/c/Users/&lt;UserName&gt;/, and you can often simply type pwd when opening a new Windows shell.\n\nSo these are different locations on your computer’s hard drive, and you will not see your Linux files in your Windows Home Directory and vice versa. To make it easy to switch between the two, I found this page on Microsoft’s web site that goes through some of the post-WSL2 installation steps, but see especially the additional page on Windows Terminal configuration.\nSlightly confusingly, you can run Linux commands directly from Windows, usually be adding wsl in front of the Linux command (e.g. wsl ls *.csv from Windows, where in Linux the command would be ls *.csv).\nTo make it easy to move from the Linux side of your machine to the Windows machine you can also do this:\n\nWork out where your CASA files are stored on the Windows side (see above: /mnt/c/Users/&lt;UserName&gt;/My\\ Documents/CASA/... where &lt;UserName&gt; is your Windows user name).\ncd to this location and type pwd to output the full path to the CASA directory.\nCopy this.\nNow start a Linux shell and run the following command once (you do not need to do it ever again): echo \"export WIN_HOME=\\\"/mnt/c/Users/.../CASA/\\\"\" &gt;&gt; $HOME/.bashrc. Replace the ... with the rest of the actual path! The \\\" is very important, don’t try to change those!\nNow run source .bashrc and you should see no errors.\n\nOnce you have done this you will have added a single line to your .bashrc file in Linux. This will create a ‘shortcut’ for bash in Linux. From here on out you should be able to type cd $WIN_HOME and move immediately over to the CASA directory on the Windows side. This will save having to remember (and type) the Windows path each time.",

If you want a recommendation, we’d probably go with the latest Ubuntu desktop release.\n\n\n\nIf your computer has less than 8GB of RAM and/or less than 20GB of free disk space you are likely to have issues with Docker and (on Windows) WSL2. Your options are: 1) add more RAM (possible on Windows); 2) back up and remove unnecessary files (Movies, Photos, and Applications are particularly big ‘hogs’).\n\nRecommendations\nIf you are looking for a recommendation as to what to buy:\n\nDon’t worry about getting the fastest chip, get as much RAM as you can. You should aim for 32GB of RAM, but get more if you can afford it.\nDon’t worry about getting the biggest hard drive, get the fastest one you can. You should get a SSD (Solid State Drive), but get a M2 type SSD if you can afford it and it’s available for your system.\nOnly after you’ve sorted this out should you look for the fastest chipset that’s still within your budget.\n\n\nShould you buy a Windows, Linux, or Apple machine?\nYou should probably stick with whatever you’re familiar with since learning your way around a new Operating System while also learning to code is just raising the bar unnecessarily. Around CASA we use a mix of all three, and you can probably find as many opinions as there are staff members.\n\n\nShould you buy a M2 or M1 Mac?\nIt depends. Here’s a good article from MacWorld covering the pros and cons. Short answer: right now (June 2022) the M1 is probably faster for most data science applications, but expect that to have changed by June 2023. But either way: a fast chip with not enough RAM will be much slower than a slow chip with abundant RAM.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSaving Money\n\n\n\nTwo easy things to do to save money on a new machine are:\n\nUnless there is a specific reason to do so (e.g. getting a system with Apple’s M1/M2 chip), don’t buy the latest machine, buy a model from earlier in the year/the previous year instead and upgrade the RAM and hard drive instead.\nOnly buy the machine when you have access to a student discount. The discount for Apple computers is relatively modest (ca. 10%) compared to ‘back to school’ offers for Windows machines, but as the Brits would say: even 10% is better than a kick in the teeth!",

    "text": "Helping Yourself\nHere are four things that you can do to ‘help yourself’ first:\n\nUse Google–this is one course where saying “I googled it…” will be taken as a good sign! Probably the biggest difference between a good programmer and a new programmer is that the good one knows which terms to type into Google to get the answer that they need right away.\nUse Stack Overflow–as you become a better programmer you’ll start to understand how to frame your question in ways that produce the answer you need in the first couple of search results, but whether you’re a beginner or an expert Stack Overflow is your friend. True story: I have sometimes found answers that I provided (but didn’t remember giving) when trying to solve a problem.\nUse the work of others–beyond the readings that we’ve assigned to support the module’s learning outcomes there is a world of knowledge out there on which you can build! Use Google Scholar, Medium, and dedicated tutorial-type sites like Towards Data Science and Programming Historian to see if you can find others who have had similar challenges.\nUse the dedicated Slack channel–this provides a much richer experience than the Moodle Forum and should be your primary means of requesting help outside of scheduled teaching hours because you can get answers from other staff, other students, and the wider CASA community.\n\nYes, this is a lot of things to do when you want to know the answer to what feels like a simple question, but it’s an investment. If we just ‘give’ you the answer then chances are you’ll forget it as soon as your code starts running again; hwoever, if you’ve had to invest your time and energy in sorting through a whole range of answers (some useful, some not) then you have found it for yourself in a way that you’ll not soon forget. In fact, you’ve learned something about both how to frame questions and how to identify useful answers. That, frankly, is a much more valuable skill!",

Sleep on it. And if you’re still stuck in the morning it’s time for the email.\nWhat does a useful email look like? You might want to follow this overview of how to get a busy person to respond to your email:\n\nKeep it short.\nFormat it for readability and clarity.\nMake it clear what you want me to do.\nBe reasonable with your request.\nShow me why I should take the time to help you.\n\nThat last point isn’t quite as rude as it sounds! If you’ve gone through steps 1–4 above, then it’s actually easy to explain what you’ve done, what you’ve found, why you think things aren’t working, and whether you have any ideas for solving your issue! If you’ve done all this then your question will never be a result of laziness, so that suggests there’s something for us to learn about how we teach!\nIn academia there are a few more things I’d add:\n\nWhat module are you emailing me about?\nWhat is your student id? (Especially if it’s about Extenuating Circumstances or an Assessment)\nIs the question about a specific practical, lecture, or technical problem?\n\nAnd here is some additional insight into how to email your professor (without being annoying AF):\n\nSalutation: should I use “Dear”, “Hello” or “Hi”?\nHonourific: should I use “Mr”, “Ms”, “Dr” or “Professor”? Hint: don’t ever use Mr/Mrs/Ms.\nName: for god’s sake, please try not to get this wrong.\nExceptions: always look at how your Prof or TA responds to you for cues about how to respond to them.\nBe nice: treat your TA and Prof like human beings please!\nRemind me who you are: anything that allows me to place you and your question in context will help me to give you effective help.\nThe reason: tell me as precisely as possible why you are emailing me and what you want/hope to achieve by doing so.\nDo the legwork (this is the ‘show me why I should take the time to help’ thing above): if the answer is in the Syllabus or the recorded content then I may not answer your question. Or I may just write “It’s in the syllabus” and leave it at that. Show me that you’ve tried to answer your question yourself and give me a sense of what you’ve already tried. For instance, if your problem is technical then “I couldn’t install the software and it didn’t work” tells me nothing about your actual problem (see also information on asking a good tech question).\nWrap-up and Sign-off: is there a deadline (e.g. for a recommendation) or some other issue that I need to factor into my plans? Some recognition of thanks never goes amiss.\n\n\nThe Follow-Up!\nIf we don’t reply to you then send a reminder! The trick is to send the reminder at the right time: if you are about to fail an assessment or are three weeks into the course and still can’t run the programming environment then your problem is urgent and you can send a reminder much sooner than if you’re wondering ‘if X would be a good topic for the final assessment’. As the Medium blogger puts it: “If it can wait a week, let it wait a week” (before following up).\n\n\nWhy This Matters\nWe all have different ‘registers’ for speaking with other people: family (siblings vs. grandparents), friends (close friends vs. acquaintances), and so on. A professionally-written email is a vital work skill since most of the people that you will end up working for will use email over all the other channels available now. Sending an email like this will not get you the help you need:\n\nHey Bossman,\nAre U awake at 2am like me? LOL. Having problems and not going to finish the report in time for meeting tomorrow. Can you give me an extension?\nLater.\n\nIf you’re worried that you might not be hitting the right ‘tone’ then it’s ok to say so and to ask if you could write it better/differently in the future. This shows reflection and thought, which is all that we really want from our students anyway!",

    "text": "What Grade Do You Want?\nFinally, we want you to think about how to learn what you need to learn. This is called meta-cognition—thinking about thinking—and it’s probably one of the most important study skills of all. So here you need to think about what you want from, for example, an assessment: do you just want to pass, or do you want to hit it out of the park?\nSome questions to ask yourself:\n\nFor an exam: What kinds of questions might it include?\nFor an essay/written piece: What kinds of topics have we covered in class?\nFor either: identify key terms, define those terms, and question the question (what might be the assumptions behind it?).\nWhich of resources would help me to study/prepare?\nHow should I make use of lecture notes, practice exam questions, textbook and other readings, instructor office hours, peer discussions, and tutoring. Write down why each resource would be useful and how you could use it to map out a study/writing plan.\nHow does my essay work as a story? I don’t necessarily mean a mystery or adventure novel, but a good essay has: a plot (what is sometimes called a narrative arc), characters (the key ideas from the literature, the data, the methods, the problems…), development (which character needs to be introduced first?), and a conclusion (what happened?). Have a look at the Tim Squirrel Guide where it talks about essay stucture.\nLooking at this literature/piece of research, is this the way that I would have done it? If I would have done it differently do I think that would have been more, or less, effective? Why or why not?\nLooking at my peers, is there someone who is doing really well who I could talk to about how they study, code, or write? How do they organise their time? How do they make use of the resources (literature, etc.)?\n\nIf all you want is a pass then organise yourself for a solid pass. If you want to excel then you’re going to have to do things a bit differently. There’s space for both approaches, but being clear about which you want will help you to prioritise the important stuff.\nAlso pay attention to what constitutes a ‘good’ output: in some cases you are being asked to write a scientific/academic essay, for which there are easy-to-follow ‘rules’, but this doesn’t work for non-scientific formats!",

    "text": "Getting Started\nIdeally, whenever you are reading an academic article (or other publication) you should be thinking about how you would differ from or improve upon or disagree with the writer. The only way you can do this (and consequently, the only way to get a decent mark) is to do some careful reading:\n\nLook at the reading list. If it seems incredibly long, then your instructor is not expecting you to read it all. What they are expecting you to do is look through it and pick out the articles that speak to you (subject to guidance about what reading is essential) and to your take on the assessments. So a long reading list is not an excuse to not read any of it. Look through the list, identify if there are any readings marked as essential. Read them. If there aren’t any essential readings, pick a few which look interesting and relevant, then read them.\nRead some more. Look through the Bibliographies of the papers and books you’ve just read. See where their ideas came from. Mark out a few of the most promising-looking readings. Read them.\nNote the difference between reading to understand the topic and reading to reference. It is totally fine to use Wikipedia, lecture notes, etc to familiarise yourself with the key arguments and concepts. It is considerably less fine to cite them as your only sources.\nArticles. Read the abstract first. Does it look like it’s relevant? If not, don’t waste your time. If it does, skim it to develop a better sense of how it’s organised, what the intro and conclusion say and whether it’s worth your time to read it more closely. Skip all equations/code. Look over the bibliography as above.\nBooks. In an ideal world you should read books. Great books. Like mine of course! :-) More realistically, unless your entire dissertation hinges on a particular argument made in great detail, then for undergraduate and masters’ study do not read whole books. It’s a waste of your time. You won’t remember any of it, it will drain all of your energy, and you only get one reference and viewpoint out of it. Read the intro and conclusion so that you get the gist of their argument. Pick a chapter from the contents page which looks like it’s relevant to your essay. Read that. As above, find relevant references and follow them up.\nIf an article is worth reading in detail, then Read critically. For the sake of all that is holy, read critically. This is absolutely essential. Don’t just stare at the pages and try to absorb them like a plant absorbs nutrients. Ask yourself questions (why did they do this? do I think that was a good idea? how would I have done this?) and try to make the process active.\n\nSo things to think about while reading articles:\n\nThe central claim the author is making. Usually there is only one, perhaps two. Summarise it in one sentence if you can.\nWhat is the frame of their argument? When in history is it set? Who are the key actors? Are they responding to another author? If so, what is the argument they’re responding to? Try to position their argument in context. This allows you to:\nCritically assess the claims made. This obviously doesn’t just mean ‘say they’re wrong’. They might well be wrong, but you’ll need to find reasons for it. Generate a list of three reasons for each line of attack you want to take. Scrap the weakest two. If you think they’re right, why are they right? Are there other authors who corroborate their claims? Are there logical reasons to prefer their argument?",
